# Todo App Phase II Implementation Plan

## PROMPT_TEXT

You are Claude Code operating under a STRICT Spec-Driven Development workflow.

PHASE: PLAN

PROJECT:
Phase II — Todo Full-Stack Web Application

INPUT:
All specifications for Phase II have been finalized in /specs directory:
- overview.md
- architecture.md
- features/task-crud.md
- features/authentication.md
- api/rest-endpoints.md
- database/schema.md
- ui/pages.md
- ui/components.md

OBJECTIVE:
Generate a **PLAN** from the specifications that will later be broken into tasks and implemented via Claude Code.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT write any implementation code
- DO NOT break into tasks yet (that is the next phase)
- Only generate a high-level **plan**
- Use clear hierarchical structure:
    - Feature / Module / Component
    - Responsibilities
    - Dependencies
    - Input/Output expectations
- Highlight any **prerequisites** for each module (e.g., auth must exist before task CRUD)
- Align strictly with the **Phase-2 constitution.md**
- Include references to relevant specs (e.g., @specs/features/task-crud.md)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Produce the plan in Markdown
- Use sections and bullet points
- Include all features, frontend, backend, database, and authentication modules
- Each plan item should have a clear **objective**, **inputs**, **outputs**, and **dependencies**

FILES:
- Single output Markdown file named: /specs/plan.md

BEGIN PLAN PHASE NOW.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II) in /specs/plan.md. The plan includes:

- Technical Context section outlining the project overview and technology stack
- Constitution Check verifying compliance with Phase II requirements
- Implementation Gates confirming feasibility and compliance
- Nine major modules covering database, authentication, backend API, frontend, UI components, task CRUD, authentication flow, integration, and deployment
- Detailed subtasks for each module with objectives, inputs, outputs, and dependencies
- Prerequisites and dependencies mapping showing critical path and parallel development opportunities
- Security considerations and quality assurance measures

The plan follows the Spec-Driven Development workflow and aligns with all constitutional requirements for the full-stack application.
